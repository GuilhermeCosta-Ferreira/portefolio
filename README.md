## BSc Biomedical Engineering
In the following section, I present all the relevant work I did during my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering at the Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon. These include:
- [PIC Project: Analysis and Correlation of Brain Motor Information in the Context of BMIs](#pic-project-analysis-and-correlation-of-brain-motor-information-in-the-context-of-bmis)


### PIC Project: Analysis and Correlation of Brain Motor Information in the Context of BMIs
---
This is my final bachelor project (PIC Project). It was a joint work between IST and the Champalimaud Foundation. Here, we analysed how we can use machine learning algorithms to decode arm movement from neuron activity (action potentials). For it, we used the dataset from the [Neural Latents Benchmark](https://neurallatents.github.io/datasets): MC Maze.

#### Abstract
Using Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI) to solve health problems related to the nervous system has proven a promising approach. With innovative studies that allow motor rehabilitation to companies developing and commercialising devices that grant seamless computer integration, the future solution to these problems lies with BMIs. We developed and applied two models: (a) Population vector and (2) Naïve Bayes to decode from 182 motor neurons’ hand movement from the MC Maze dataset. After optimisation, we obtained 0.24 and 0.45 in R2 correlation, respectively. They were able to shed light on many characteristics of the motor cortex, such as the tuning of the neurons and the increased amount of information they code. This information granted the possibility of improvement and adaptations of our models. However, we did not obtain correlations closer to other models applied to this dataset, as our decoders lacked developed
preprocessing steps. Nonetheless, this project works as an introduction to the BMI problem.
